# la-teatru-eventswebservice

This component is part of the infrastructure supporting the iOS/Android apps "La Teatru" launched in mid-2010 and taken down about a year after that.

It was the backend component responsible with serving all clients via HTTP using a REST API with JSON as the transport protocol. The data was stored in a MySQL database.
